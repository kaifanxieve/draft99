The Non-Bypassability Proposition (KFX Seal Blade)

Proposition K (World–Observation Closure)

If a system satisfies the following three conditions:

Its world is defined as the set of valid histories;

Observation is defined as the distinguishability among valid histories;

The system does not presuppose a global evolution function, and allows only local step rules plus global constraints;

then:

Any minimal formal system that makes such a world observable for the first time
must be structurally isomorphic to the minimal kernel of KFX,
or cannot be made smaller without changing the problem itself.

Equivalent Compressed Form

Any system that:

defines the world as a set of histories,

defines observation as distinguishability among histories, and

refuses to presuppose an evolution function,

has a minimal threshold for the emergence of observability
that cannot bypass KFX.
